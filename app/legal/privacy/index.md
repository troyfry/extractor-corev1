# Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: {{Insert Date}}_

Thank you for using our Free Work Order Extractor (“Service”).  
This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### **1.1 Uploaded Files**
When you upload a file (PDF or image), it is processed temporarily for extraction purposes only.  
**We do not store your uploaded files or extracted data.**  
All processing is done in memory and discarded after the extraction is complete.

### **1.2 IP Address (Hashed)**
To prevent abuse and enforce fair-use limits, we collect a **non-reversible hash** of your IP address.

We do **not** store your raw IP address.

This hashed value is used solely to:

- Apply daily usage limits  
- Apply monthly usage limits  
- Maintain service integrity  

No other tracking or profiling is performed.

### **1.3 Usage Metadata**
We may log minimal technical information such as:

- Timestamp of extraction  
- Success or failure of processing  

This helps diagnose issues and maintain system performance.  
No personal identifiers are included.

---

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information described above only for the following purposes:

- Providing the extraction service  
- Enforcing fair-use limits on the Free tier  
- Preventing misuse or abuse of the Service  
- Improving system reliability and performance  

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your information with third parties.

---

## 3. How AI Processing Works

Uploaded files are processed securely via our AI provider (e.g., OpenAI API).  
Files are transmitted only for extraction and are not stored by us after the request is completed.

We do **not** use your content to train our models.

Please refer to OpenAI’s own data privacy policies for details on their retention practices.

---

## 4. Data Retention

- Hashed IP entries are retained only as long as needed to enforce usage limits (typically 30–60 days).  
- Uploaded files and extracted content are **never stored**.  
- Technical logs (no personal data) may be retained briefly for maintenance.

---

## 5. Cookies

The Free version does **not** use cookies or tracking technologies.

If you upgrade to a Pro or Premium plan, authentication cookies may be used for login sessions.  
This policy applies specifically to the Free tool.

---

## 6. Your Rights

If you are located in the EU, UK, or similar regions, you may have certain rights related to personal data.  
Because we do not store personal data in the Free version (other than hashed IP), these rights generally do not apply beyond deletion of usage records.

You may contact us at any time to request deletion of your hashed IP usage entry.

---

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally.  
If changes are significant, we will update the date above and display a notice on the website.
